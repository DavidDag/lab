# Predicting Banking Customer Churn by Unlocking Big Data
 
 ## Introduction
 
Customer churn and engagement has become one of the top issues for most banks. It costs significantly more to acquire new customers than retain existing ones, and it costs far more to reacquire deflected customers. In fact, several studies have proven that churn remains one of the biggest destructors of enterprise values.
 
In order to identify early signs of potential churn and take actions to avoid losing customers, organizations start getting a holistic view of the customers including their interactions across multiple channels such as bank visits, calls to customer service departments, web-based transactions, mobile banking and social media interactions. 
 
By leveraging the holistic customer information, organizations can build a viable churn prediction model. The churn prediction model with high predictive score will arm organizations with the insights to identify customers with high-risk churn so they can take specific proactive actions to prevent churn.
 
In a nutshell, the use of Big Data and sophisticated machine learning models give banks a distinct competitive advantage to predict and prevent churn, drive cross-sell and build customer loyalty.
 
In this workshop, you will learn how to use IBM's industry leading Data Science Experience to create churn prediction models using notebooks and visual Model Builder, and deploy the models to a live system, and monitor and evaluate the model performance over time.
